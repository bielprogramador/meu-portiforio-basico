        <p>Hello, my name is Gabriel, I'm currently 15 years old and I know the basics of HTML and CSS... <br> But I currently study Java, and I have programming as a hobby, I love programming and dedicating my time learning, <br> of course we have to get our hands dirty and codar, I also study English, that's <br> why I made this portiforium in English and that's it, every day we learn more! <br> <br> When I'm free, I really like coding in Java, sometimes I play football with my friends, I ride my bike and do lots of cool things. <br>I don't really like playing on the computer because I think I would waste a lot of <br> my life playing and I confess I played a lot, but nowadays I'm focused on learning programming. <br> <br> I'm currently studying to get into the 2nd technical degree, Systems Development at Etec... not if you've heard of this school, but I'm studying to be able to pass the test... Especially because if I have a 2nd technical degree at area would be much easier for me to get into a job in the programming area
